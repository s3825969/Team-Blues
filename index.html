IT is an exciting field. Daily new innovations and advancements in technology have contributed to develop my interest in IT. I love the concept of making new websites and software. My interest in IT started during my teenage because of my elder cousin who encouraged me to opt computer as a major subject during my secondary education. I  donot have previous experience in IT but my current experience with IT is really outstanding.</p>
